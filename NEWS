Changes in Version 0.1-4

  o  Summary statistics are written to a ESRI Shapefile.

  o  Added new functions for reading configuration files (ReadParConfig and
     ReadPlotConfig) and a geo-referenced site location file
     (ReadSiteLocations).

  o  The 'Min', 'Max', 'Start_date', and 'End_date' fields have been removed
     from the plot configuration files. Users need to update their input files
     to account for this change.

  o  Graphics now opened in a platform-independent way using the
     grDevices::dev.new function.

  o  Many of the function names were updated using a more explicit naming
     convention.

  o  The tcltk package is no longer required. Removed Tcl/Tk dialog boxes for
     file and directory selection. Default directory arguments are the working
     directory and file path names must be passed as arguments.

  o  Fixed calculation of the number of samples above the reporting limit
     (n_above_rl); previous value did not include the number of estimated (E)
     samples.

  o  Plot legends show p-value as less than 0.001; previously these labels were
     represented as "p-value = 0.000".

  o  Nonparametric regression is prevented when NADA::cenfit function results in
     warnings.

  o  Warn if site ids in configuration files do not match ids in the data file.

  o  Added a new function MergePDFs, combines PDF files into a new file.
