Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o  This version represents a major change in the package and breaks compatibility with older versions.
     The impetus for this change was a need to model interval-censored data.
     A parametric survial regression model is fit to the observed data, both censored and uncensored.

Changes in Version 0.1-5

  o  Fixed bug in RunTrendAnalysis function that dropped matrix class for spatial data frames with a single coordinate value.

  o  Fixed bug in RunTrendAnalysis function that tried to compute trend when summary statistics returned from NADA::cenfit function were incomplete.

  o  Added a package CITATION file and a LaTeX bibliography source file.

  o  Added argument in MergePDFs function to remove individual files after merge is completed.

Changes in Version 0.1-4

  o  Added a package vignette describing 2014 water quality data processing.

  o  Summary statistics are written to a shapefile.

  o  Added new functions for reading configuration files (ReadParConfig and ReadPlotConfig) and a geo-referenced site location file (ReadSiteLocations).

  o  The 'Min', 'Max', 'Start_date', and 'End_date' fields have been removed from the plot configuration files.
     Users need to update their input files to account for this change.

  o  Graphics now opened in a platform-independent way using the grDevices::dev.new function.

  o  Many of the function names were updated using a more explicit naming convention.

  o  The tcltk package is no longer required. Removed Tcl/Tk dialog boxes for file and directory selection.
     Default directory arguments are the working directory and file path names must be passed as arguments.

  o  Fixed calculation of the number of samples above the reporting limit (n_above_rl); previous value did not include the number of estimated (E) samples.

  o  Plot legends show "p-value < 0.001"; previously these labels were shown as "p-value = 0.000".

  o  Nonparametric regression is prevented when NADA::cenfit function results in warnings.

  o  Warn if site ids in configuration files do not match ids in the data file.

  o  Added a new function MergePDFs, combines PDF files into a new file.
